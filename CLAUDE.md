# Connect 2 — working rules for Claude

## AGENT HANDOFF — Audio/Reliability/Notifications engagement (2026-07-29)

The full handoff for the July 29 all-day session (mobile audio saga, push
notification rebuild, wire-truth SIP liveness, ghost-registration fix, PBX
FEC + wake-rb removal mandates) is committed at
**`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_AUDIO_RELIABILITY_2026-07-29.md`** on branch
`feat/ai-agent`. Read it AND `docs/ai-context/NOTIFICATION_RELIABILITY.md`
BEFORE touching mobile SIP/audio code, push notifications, TURN/relay config,
or the PBX codecs.conf.

Session-critical facts (details + evidence in the handoff doc):
- Published fleet build = `1.0.0+20260729.6` (commit `a0eb96bf`). A `.7`
  candidate (volume-hush + serialized register, commit `a4524f6c`) is built,
  verified on Izzy's phone, and **explicitly NOT published — never publish
  without Izzy's word.**
- Three suspended features need a SUPERVISED incoming-call re-proof, ONE at a
  time (both mic-dead incidents rode builds carrying them): opus-only ANSWERS,
  earpiece loudness boost, presence Equalizer.
- JsSIP discards UA-level pcConfig — per-call `callPcConfig` is the fix; TURN
  creds expire in 24h — `/voice/ice-servers` + register-time overlay keeps
  them fresh. Never regress either.
- PBX mandates live: `[opus] fec=yes, packet_loss=5` (never 10 — it muffles);
  the cowork wake-rb dialplan intercept on T21_101 is DISABLED (backup in
  /root on the PBX).
- The TURN relay (coturn on loopcom) works but is in FRANCE vs the PBX in
  St. Louis (+150ms) — a US relay VPS is the pending purchase/decision.
- One change per build; supervised USB+logcat test before anything
  audio/mic-related reaches Izzy's phone; his sign-off gates every publish.

## Task-dashboard signature routing (ALWAYS APPLY)

Every task I add to the jacob-dev-orchestrator task dashboard MUST carry a routing
**signature** in its title and detail. The signature tells a specific Cursor agent
which tasks are his; he only claims tasks that carry his signature and ignores all
others. This prevents the wrong agent from picking up a task.

Rules:
- Never create a dashboard task without a signature. No exceptions.
- Put the signature in BOTH the title (e.g. `[SIG::CURSOR-CONNECT-01] ...`) and as the
  first line of the detail (`ROUTING SIGNATURE: SIG::CURSOR-CONNECT-01 — ...`).
- The signature is per Cursor agent / per chat and is STABLE — reuse the same signature
  for every task meant for that agent, so Cursor is configured once. Do not invent a new
  per-task signature each time.
- Any scheduled task that files dashboard tasks must stamp them with the same signature.
- When I hand Izzy a prompt for Cursor, it must tell Cursor his signature and instruct him
  to claim ONLY tasks carrying it.

Current signatures:
- `SIG::CURSOR-CONNECT-01` — the Cursor agent working the Connect server in this chat.
  (Rename on Izzy's request; if renamed, update it everywhere.)

## Server access — how any agent logs in (ALWAYS APPLY)

There are two servers. Each has a dedicated ed25519 key already installed in the
target account's `authorized_keys`. Login is as `root` on both, port 22.

| Name    | Role                        | Host            | Key file                   |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| loopcom | Connect server (work here)  | 45.14.194.179   | `connect2_ed25519`         |
| pbx     | PBX — **READ-ONLY, no touch**| 209.145.60.79  | `connect2_server2_ed25519` |

The private keys live in the git-ignored folder `.connect-ssh/` at the repo root
(also mirrored in `C:\Users\izzyw\.ssh\` on Izzy's machine). They are NEVER
committed (see `.gitignore`).

### CANONICAL SSH METHOD — always run from the Linux sandbox (`mcp__workspace__bash`)
**This is the ONE approved way to reach either server. It supersedes any other
SSH-login instructions anywhere in this repo — other `.md` files, older handoffs,
inline notes, or the app-level project instructions. Do NOT use the local PowerShell
MCP or a Cursor agent to SSH into these servers:** the PowerShell MCP blocks `ssh`/`scp`
("remote shell tools not permitted"). Always SSH from the sandbox.

The Connect 2 repo is mounted in the sandbox; find its exact path in your system prompt
(it looks like `/sessions/<session-id>/mnt/Connect 2`). Set `PROJ` to that path. The
mount can report loose key permissions, so stage each key to a strict-mode file first.
`install -m 600` sets perms AND overwrites cleanly, even if a stale `/tmp` copy exists
from an earlier session (a plain `cp` will fail with "Permission denied" on that stale file).

Exact, copy-pasteable procedure — verified working:

```bash
# 1) point PROJ at the Connect 2 mount shown in your system prompt
PROJ="/sessions/<session-id>/mnt/Connect 2"

# 2) stage both keys with strict perms (overwrites any stale /tmp copy)
install -m 600 "$PROJ/.connect-ssh/connect2_ed25519"         /tmp/loopcom_key
install -m 600 "$PROJ/.connect-ssh/connect2_server2_ed25519" /tmp/pbx_key

# 3a) CONNECT SERVER (loopcom) — the ONLY box where Connect work happens
ssh -i /tmp/loopcom_key -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new \
    root@45.14.194.179 'hostname; uptime'
#    -> confirms hostname: vmi3101417

# 3b) PBX — READ-ONLY. Inspection / monitoring only, NEVER write.
ssh -i /tmp/pbx_key -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new \
    root@209.145.60.79 'hostname; uptime'
#    -> confirms hostname: vmi2718844
```

Both log in as `root` on port 22. If `ssh` is missing in the sandbox:
`apt-get install -y openssh-client` (usually preinstalled).

**Requires a sandbox with outbound network egress.** The `mcp__workspace__bash` sandbox
has it — verified reaching both boxes (loopcom `vmi3101417`, pbx `vmi2718844`). If you are
in a shell/mode whose network is unreachable (e.g. an on-device VM), SSH will time out /
"Network is unreachable" — that is a networking limitation of that shell, not a key or
host problem. Switch to the networked `mcp__workspace__bash` sandbox and re-run the steps above.

For Izzy to log in manually from Windows (keys are in his `~/.ssh`):
```
ssh -i C:\Users\izzyw\.ssh\connect2_ed25519 root@45.14.194.179          # loopcom
ssh -i C:\Users\izzyw\.ssh\connect2_server2_ed25519 root@209.145.60.79  # pbx
```

### Guardrails on server access
- **loopcom (45.14.194.179)** is the only box where Connect work happens, and even
  there: deploy/restart only via the deploy queue; no `git add -A`.
- **pbx (209.145.60.79) is strictly READ-ONLY.** Inspect and report only. Never take
  write actions on the PBX — this is a hard guardrail.
- Never touch payments or pension from either box.

## Other standing rules
- Read-only monitoring runs never take write actions on the Connect server, PBX,
  payments, or pension — report only.
- Hard guardrails on all Connect work: Connect server only; never touch payments,
  pension, or the PBX; deploy/restart only via the deploy queue; no `git add -A`.

## B Visible engagement (2026-07-17 → 07-22) — where the handoff lives

The full agent handoff for the B Visible work done from this chat is committed in the
B Visible repo: `C:\dev\projects\B Visible\docs\AGENT_HANDOFF.md` (commit `1ea222d`,
branch `feat/premium-estimate-editor-workspace`). Read it before touching B Visible.

Session-critical facts for THIS environment:
- Reaching the B Visible server (`deploy@212.56.32.136`) works from the Linux sandbox
  (`mcp__workspace__bash`), key staged from `.connect-ssh/cursor_bvisible` to
  `/tmp/bv_key` with mode 600 (re-stage after sandbox resets — you'll see
  "Permission denied (publickey)"). The local PowerShell MCP blocks any command
  containing the word "deploy" and gates `git push` / recursive deletes behind
  `approved:true`.
- Builds/git for B Visible run ONLY on Windows via the `.agent-run.cmd` batch pattern
  (set PATH **and PATHEXT**; poll `.agent-build.log`; never `-Wait` on long jobs;
  PowerShell needs `-LiteralPath` for paths containing `[id]`).
- A Cursor agent edits the B Visible repo in parallel — `git status` before every
  edit, re-copy current file versions before modifying, never commit their WIP,
  never `git add -A`.

## AGENT HANDOFF — Shammes AI agent / PBX M-capabilities engagement (2026-07-26 → 07-28)

The full handoff for the AI-agent work (DND, hold music, LLM-first parsing,
chat uploads, and the M3/M4/M10 native PBX capabilities) is committed at
**`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_SHAMMES_PBX_MS.md`** on branch `feat/ai-agent`.
Read it before touching `apps/agent`, the `/internal/agent/*` API doors, or
`scripts/pbx/vitalpbx-inbound-route-helper.py`.

Session-critical facts (details + evidence in the handoff doc):
- **VitalPBX's REST `apply_changes` is broken on this build** — returns success
  without regenerating tenant conf files. The PBX helper therefore **bakes**
  changes directly into `/etc/asterisk/vitalpbx/extensions__50-<t>-dialplan.conf`
  (guarded patch: backup + scope check + atomic replace + dialplan reload).
  Never assume a DB write or REST apply reached live routing — verify the baked
  file / `dialplan show`.
- PBX helper deployed at `/opt/connect-pbx-helper/vitalpbx-inbound-route-helper.py`
  (v2026.07.28.5, in sync with the repo copy). Its `audit.jsonl` is **61 GB** —
  never grep it whole.
- PBX writes happened ONLY under Izzy's explicit mandates (`dnd-2026-07-26`,
  `moh-2026-07-26`, `pbxcfg-2026-07-28`). The default PBX read-only guardrail
  still stands for anything outside those mandates.
- M3 (inbound routing) + M10 members are live-proven end-to-end through real
  chat on Landau's tenant (T21). M4 (IVR) is built but unproven — the test
  tenant has no IVR, and IVR writes still need the same bake treatment.
- In THIS Cursor environment ssh/scp run directly from PowerShell with the keys
  in `C:\Users\izzyw\.ssh\` — but NEVER pipe file bytes through PowerShell to
  ssh (corruption); always `scp` + remote `py_compile` before installing.

## AGENT HANDOFF — Onboarding automation engagement (2026-07-26 → 07-28)

The full handoff for the automated onboarding work (wizard → VoIP.ms number +
subaccount → VitalPBX tenant build → Connect sync → invite emails, plus the
stress-test wipe procedure) is committed at
**`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_ONBOARDING_AUTOMATION.md`** on branch
`feat/ai-agent`. Read it before touching `apps/api/src/onboarding/`, the
portal wizard, or before wiping test tenants.

Session-critical facts (details + evidence in the handoff doc):
- **Deploys ship from branch `feat/ai-agent`**, via
  `bash scripts/deploy-direct.sh api|portal --branch feat/ai-agent` on loopcom.
  Always verify the container commit afterwards.
- Live gates `VOIPMS_AUTO_PROVISION=on` / `ONBOARDING_PBX_AUTO_SETUP=on` are
  wired in `docker-compose.app.yml`; unset = silent dry-run (statuses
  `ready_dryrun` / `dry_run_done`).
- **VitalPBX panel deletes are TWO-STEP** (delete → re-POST the confirmation
  form's hidden inputs, `mode:"deleteConfirmed"`) and must be verified by
  re-listing — the single-step call "succeeds" without deleting (two earlier
  wipes left every trunk/route/ARS behind because of this). Reference
  implementation: `scripts/onboarding/_wipe-round2.mts`. Order: tenants
  (REST) → ars → trunk_group → trunks. REST `deleteTenant` may exceed 20 s —
  poll for absence on timeout.
- **VoIP.ms**: `setSubAccount` is a full update (partial `{id,password}`
  fails); `createSubAccount` `used_username` self-heals by reusing (commit
  `db4453f8`); subaccounts are `344022_<name>` — suffix-match, never prefix
  with the API login email; `device_type 1` = Asterisk (correct), `2` = IP
  phone (wrong); outages return Cloudflare 521/522 HTML — retry with backoff.
- Test numbers are pre-owned STOCK: wipes re-route DIDs to `account:344022`,
  never cancel them. Spare DIDs show first in the wizard ("Ready now");
  the search cache holds only the purchasable list, spares always fresh.
- Reusable stress-test link token: `stress-WBcv2eWu8GzxdIIP2glmd6O2`
  (`/onboarding/test/<token>` spawns a fresh run). Invites only go out for
  emails never used anywhere on the platform (global uniqueness).
- Ezra's test IP `173.212.214.198` is allowlisted in
  `/etc/nginx/connectcomms/allowlist.conf` (nginx auto-ban hit it mid-test).
- In THIS Cursor environment ssh/scp run directly from PowerShell (keys in
  `C:\Users\izzyw\.ssh\`); server scripts run via scp → `docker cp` →
  `tsx` inside `app-api-1`; DB one-liners pipe JS into
  `docker exec -i -w /app/packages/db app-api-1 node -`.

## AGENT HANDOFF — Mobile Android call-reliability engagement (2026-07-27 → 07-28)

Read this whole section before touching `apps/mobile`. It is the handoff from the
Cursor chat that did the July 27–28 reliability push. Owner's bar for this work:
answering a call must be **instantaneous** ("a blink of an eye"), calls must
survive the app being swiped away, and NOTHING that already works may break.

### Environment / workflow facts (verified working)

- **Test device**: Izzy's Samsung over USB ADB, serial `RFCXC0CEZ6V`. It comes and
  goes — run `adb devices` first; `adb wait-for-device` to block until plugged in.
  The phone is on **T-Mobile, an IPv6-only network** (DNS64/NAT64) — this shaped
  several fixes below.
- **Build**: `cd apps\mobile\android && .\gradlew :app:assembleRelease` (≈5 min).
  Output: `apps\mobile\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`.
- **Install**: `adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`, then
  launch and confirm logcat shows `[SIP] Registered successfully` and
  `[IN_CALL_NOTIF] module-scope action listener installed`.
- **Publish to the download page**: `powershell -File scripts/android-publish.ps1
  -Version "1.0.0+<yyyymmdd>" -ReleaseNotes "..."` — uploads to
  `/opt/connectcomms/downloads` on loopcom via the `connect` SSH alias, promotes
  `connectcomms-latest.apk`, writes the JSON manifest, smoke-tests
  `https://app.connectcomunications.com/api/downloads/connectcomms-latest.apk`.
  Last published: `connectcomms-v1.0.0+20260728.apk`.
- **Known pre-existing `tsc` error** (NOT ours, does not block builds):
  `src/delivery/trackingService.ts` — `Cannot find module 'expo-battery'`. Another
  agent's delivery-tracking work. Everything else typechecks clean.
- **Feature flag**: `standingRegistration` must be `true` on the user's
  `MobileDevice` row (Postgres on loopcom, user `connectcomms`) or the app falls
  back to legacy slow-answer behavior. It is INHERITED on push-token rotation now,
  but if a device re-registers from scratch, re-check it.

### The one architectural rule that explains most of this engagement

**A recents-swipe destroys MainActivity and unmounts the ENTIRE React tree, but
the process (and the JsSIP singleton + WebRTC media) lives on** under the
`SipKeepAliveService` FGS. Anything that must keep working while swiped away —
notification button handling, native notification cleanup, Telecom anchor
teardown, SIP registration — must live at **module scope** (imported via
`sipClientSingleton.ts`) or **natively**, never inside `SipContext`/components.
Three separate bugs came from violating this:

1. Notification Hang Up/Speaker/Mute dead after swipe → fixed by module-scope
   listener `apps/mobile/src/sip/inCallNotificationActions.ts` (installed at
   import time by `sipClientSingleton.ts`). `SipContext`'s listener now ONLY
   mirrors UI state — do not re-add client calls there (double-execution).
2. Remote hangup while swiped left a stale in-call notification + phantom
   Telecom call → `nativeCallEndedCleanup()` in `jssip.ts` (fires on last
   confirmed session ended/failed) calls `stopInCallNotification` +
   `telecomTerminateAnchors`; `TelecomBridge.terminateAnchorConnections()`
   tears down `tc-anchor-*` connections natively.
3. Reopening the app mid-call landed on Teams with no way back to the call →
   `SipContext` mount-effect hydration (`[SIP_HYDRATE]` log tag): reads
   `client.listSessions()`, rebuilds callState/remoteParty/hold, replays
   sessions into `CallSessionManager` (which now buckets already-active/held
   sessions and backdates `answeredAt` from `SipSessionInfo.confirmedAtMs` so
   the timer doesn't restart at 0:00).

### Other landmines (do not regress)

- **`react-native-callkeep` used to KILL THE PROCESS in `onHostDestroy`** — that
  was the original "call dies on swipe" cause. Fixed via pnpm patch
  `patches/react-native-callkeep@4.3.16.patch` (wired in root `package.json`
  `pnpm.patchedDependencies`). Never remove that patch.
- **In-call notification uses PLAIN action buttons, not CallStyle.** CallStyle on
  Samsung One UI rendered the Speaker chip white-on-white and silently dropped
  the Mute action. Buttons: Hang up / Speaker / Mute in
  `SipKeepAliveService.buildInCallNotification()`. Hangup rides a
  `PendingIntent.getService` → `ACTION_NOTIF_HANGUP_SVC` → EXPLICIT broadcast to
  `InCallNotificationReceiver` (implicit broadcasts never arrive) → JS event.
  Notification body tap deep-links `com.connectcommunications.mobile://active-call`
  (handled in `RootNavigator`).
- **Audio routing after connect goes through Telecom, not AudioManager.** Once the
  answer-time Telecom anchor flips ACTIVE, `AudioManager.setSpeakerphoneOn` is
  silently overridden. `IncomingCallUiModule.routeViaTelecom()` routes through
  `Connection.setAudioRoute()` first, falling back to AudioManager. `SipContext`
  re-asserts the user's route 600/1800 ms after anchor activation.
- **T-Mobile IPv6 blackhole**: first WSS connect over synthesized IPv6 can hang
  ~10 s. `SipSocketModule.kt` + `nativeSipSocket.ts` (custom OkHttp WebSocket,
  IPv4-first DNS, 6 s connect timeout) fixed cold-start answer from 10 s → ~0.4 s.
  Do not swap SIP back to React Native's stock WebSocket.
- **CGNAT idle kill**: T-Mobile drops idle sockets ≈5 min. Keepalives: JsSIP
  OPTIONS every 45 s foreground; native heartbeat every 4 min
  (`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_STANDING_IDLE_MS`) driving a forced REGISTER refresh via
  the headless task even when JsSIP thinks it's registered.
- **Never re-introduce a VitalPBX tenant PUT / any PBX write** — see the ABSOLUTE
  RULE in `AGENTS.md`. PBX is read-only, enforced in code.

### Shipped in the 2026-07-28 builds (user-visible)

- Instantaneous answer paths (in-app, lock screen, floating notification, cold
  start), `iceCandidatePoolSize: 1`, register watchdogs at 12 s/12.5 s.
- Call survives swipe-away; working notification controls; tap → ActiveCall.
- Speaker/Bluetooth work after connect (Telecom routing).
- Add Call button on ActiveCallScreen (hold current + dial second,
  `allowSecond: true`, reuses `TransferModal` with custom label/icon).
- Voicemail: reload much faster (parallel page fetch in `getVoicemails`, respects
  `maxPagesPerFolder`); Download now saves to the PUBLIC Downloads folder via
  `DownloadsModule.kt` (`ConnectDownloads.saveToDownloads`, MediaStore) with
  filename `Voicemail <caller> <date>.wav`.
- Colored person-icon avatars for unknown numbers (Recents/SMS,
  `colorForName` exported from `Avatar.tsx`).
- Removed the unrequested "Delivery driver" row from Settings.
- Implemented missing `reportDndStatus` in `api/client.ts` (another agent's
  import would have crashed at runtime).

### State at handoff / what to verify next

All of the above is installed on the test device and published to the download
page. Awaiting owner verification at handoff time: hangup/speaker/mute from the
notification **while swiped away**, notification tap → ActiveCall with a running
timer, and voicemail download appearing in Files → Downloads. If a regression
surfaces, start with logcat tags: `IN_CALL_NOTIF`, `SIP_HYDRATE`, `CALL_NAV`,
`MULTICALL`, `SIP_KEEPALIVE`, `CONNECT_CALL_UI`.
