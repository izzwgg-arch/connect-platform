# ⛔ AGENT HANDOFF — ElevenLabs "didn't play" + pipeline hardening (2026-08-04) — READ FIRST for ElevenLabs, IVR Studio recordings, or any "audio didn't play in the browser" report

Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_ELEVENLABS_PLAYBACK_2026-08-04.md`**

- **"Didn't play" was Izzy's CHROME, not the product.** His Chrome's media
  pipeline wedged globally: every `<audio>`/`<video>` stalled at `readyState 0`
  with no error, `play()` pending forever — while `decodeAudioData` worked and
  the server had delivered valid WAV with 200s all four times. Same probe in a
  second browser on the same machine played instantly. Fix = full Chrome
  restart (**unconfirmed at handoff — ask first**); next suspect is his filter
  extension. ⛔ Run the silent-WAV probe (handoff §1) before shipping ANY fix
  for a "didn't play" report.
- Hardening shipped as `16f05d2d` on `feat/ivr-migration-takeover`; **ALL
  THREE HALVES DEPLOYED as of 2026-08-05**: api (container at `9b521176`),
  portal (hardening markers grep-verified inside the live `.next` build), and
  agent (manual compose rebuild 2026-08-05 ~00:30 ET under Izzy's explicit
  permission — the deploy queue has NO agent service, agent is always a manual
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.app.yml -f docker-compose.agent.yml build
  agent && up -d agent`; new container verified healthy with both fixes).
  Highlights: visible preview player + 4s playing-event watchdog + honest
  stall message; timeouts on every modal fetch; 30s server-side read cache +
  single read retry; 12/min per-IP + 4-concurrent synthesis guards; client
  faults 400 not 502; agent hot-reload was missing the ElevenLabs key (saved
  keys were invisible until restart — fixed).
- **2026-08-05: the generate route had never worked** — it selected `slug`
  from Tenant, and **the Tenant model has NO slug column**, so every
  `POST /voice/ivr/prompts/generate` died in PrismaClientValidationError (and
  the portal dialog rendered the raw Prisma dump to the customer). Fixed
  `9b521176`, deployed + live-verified same day. ⛔ `TenantPbxPrompt.tenantSlug`
  is ALWAYS derived from `Tenant.name` via the `toIvrSlug` normalisation
  (lowercase, non-alnum → `_`) — a differently-formatted slug makes rows
  invisible to the prompt list and PBX prefix matching. Handoff doc §5.
- **Global error-handler safety net (`4fb512ed`, handoff §6) is ✅ DEPLOYED**
  as of 2026-08-06 inside api `7f7ec541` — uncaught route errors no longer show
  raw internals in customer dialogs. Root cause of the leak: the api container sets NO
  `NODE_ENV` (only telephony does in docker-compose.app.yml), so the old
  handler's "production" branch never ran — June-era protection sat dead for
  months. ⛔ Never gate safety behavior on `NODE_ENV` in apps/api; the portal
  (`services/apiClient.ts`, `MakeRecording.tsx`) renders the server `message`
  field verbatim by design, so the server body IS the customer-facing text.
- ⛔ **Never retry a synthesis POST** (double-bills characters) and **never
  stress-test against prod** (real money; the offline fake-provider suite in
  `elevenLabsRoutes.stress.test.ts` IS the stress test). 49/49 tests green via
  `node --experimental-test-module-mocks --import tsx --test` in apps/api.
- **`elevenLabs.test.ts` had never run** — it imported vitest, which apps/api
  doesn't install (suite runs node:test via tsx). Rewritten. The follow-up
  chips are DONE: `smsSharedInbox.test.ts` fixed `6976a905` (stale fake-db
  mock, route was fine); vitest imports purged across apps/api in `2b4e9232`.
  ⛔ The `6d3d0b05` merge from feat/ai-agent CLOBBERED the converted
  `dependencyHygiene.test.ts` back to the vitest version — restored from
  `2b4e9232` right after. When merging feat/ai-agent, ALWAYS take the
  node:test version of any test file (grep `from "vitest"` after every merge;
  apps/api must have zero hits).
- Two status routes look alike: `/api/voice/elevenlabs/status` (API — IVR
  Studio modal) vs `/agent-api/voice/elevenlabs/status` (agent — owner
  settings page). Don't conflate them.
