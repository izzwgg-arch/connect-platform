# ⛔ AGENT HANDOFF — CDR silent loss + live-call sync (2026-08-04) — READ FIRST for "calls missing from history", stuck/vanishing Active Calls, BLF sync, or ANY CallStateStore / CdrNotifier / ARI-poller work

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_CDR_LIVESYNC_2026-08-04.md`**

- **Calls were being permanently ERASED from call history** (~100–200/day since
  ~June, all tenants — found via "RelaxTires ext 101 sees no calls today").
  The live-call tracker force-evicted live calls off a blind ARI snapshot;
  evictions filed nothing; the 30s retention ate the late Cdr events; api
  deploys ate whatever ended during the restart. Fixed + deployed:
  `5060032f` (4-layer CDR protection incl. orphan-CDR net + Redis retry queue
  `telephony:cdr:retry:v1`) · `2f0850e7` (orphan net skips queue fork legs —
  else one phantom "missed call" PER AGENT per queue ring) · `aa3115d4`
  (live-sync rewrite). 332 lost calls Aug 1–4 backfilled; pre-Aug-1 NOT.
- ⛔ **Liveness = ARI's RAW /channels list (`rawChannelIds`), NEVER the
  qualifying-bridge list.** A queue/RG call is two half-bridges, each with one
  non-Local leg — `computeBridgedActiveCalls` excludes both BY DESIGN. Judging
  liveness by bridge membership is what killed live calls for months. Same
  trap in reverse: the WS page-load snapshot must stay the UNION of the AMI
  store + ARI-only bridges, never either/or.
- ⛔ **Never remove call channels by exact name string.** Asterisk masquerade
  renames (`<ZOMBIE>`) don't match; resolve the recorded name via uniqueid.
  A call with zero live channelIndex entries is OVER that second.
- ⛔ **Every eviction/cleanup path MUST emit `callEvicted`** (→ CdrNotifier).
  A cleanup that only emits `callRemove` silently erases the call's record.
- Backfill recipe gotchas: seed-post `disposition:"unknown"` first (else the
  ingest push-notifies stale missed calls); patch inbound direction post-hoc
  (PBX trunk legs write no cdr row); PBX local-time strings are ~4h skewed —
  derive times from the linkedId epoch. ~63 phantom rows from the first hour
  are HIDDEN via `isForwarded=true`, not deleted.
- Tenant isolation on the live feed: a mid-call tenant correction now
  broadcasts `callRemove` first so the wrong company's screens clear
  instantly. Null-tenant records go to admins only (verified).
