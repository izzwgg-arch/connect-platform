# AGENT HANDOFF — Mobile Android call-reliability engagement (2026-07-27 → 07-28)

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


Read this whole section before touching `apps/mobile`. It is the handoff from the
Cursor chat that did the July 27–28 reliability push. Owner's bar for this work:
answering a call must be **instantaneous** ("a blink of an eye"), calls must
survive the app being swiped away, and NOTHING that already works may break.

### Environment / workflow facts (verified working)

- **Test device**: Izzy's Samsung over USB ADB, serial `RFCXC0CEZ6V`. It comes and
  goes — run `adb devices` first; `adb wait-for-device` to block until plugged in.
  The phone is on **T-Mobile, an IPv6-only network** (DNS64/NAT64) — this shaped
  several fixes below.
- **Build**: `cd apps\mobile\android && .\gradlew :app:assembleRelease` (≈5 min).
  Output: `apps\mobile\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`.
- **Install**: `adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`, then
  launch and confirm logcat shows `[SIP] Registered successfully` and
  `[IN_CALL_NOTIF] module-scope action listener installed`.
- **Publish to the download page**: `powershell -File scripts/android-publish.ps1
  -Version "1.0.0+<yyyymmdd>" -ReleaseNotes "..."` — uploads to
  `/opt/connectcomms/downloads` on loopcom via the `connect` SSH alias, promotes
  `connectcomms-latest.apk`, writes the JSON manifest, smoke-tests
  `https://app.connectcomunications.com/api/downloads/connectcomms-latest.apk`.
  Last published: `connectcomms-v1.0.0+20260728.apk`.
- **Known pre-existing `tsc` error** (NOT ours, does not block builds):
  `src/delivery/trackingService.ts` — `Cannot find module 'expo-battery'`. Another
  agent's delivery-tracking work. Everything else typechecks clean.
- **Feature flag**: `standingRegistration` must be `true` on the user's
  `MobileDevice` row (Postgres on loopcom, user `connectcomms`) or the app falls
  back to legacy slow-answer behavior. It is INHERITED on push-token rotation now,
  but if a device re-registers from scratch, re-check it.

### The one architectural rule that explains most of this engagement

**A recents-swipe destroys MainActivity and unmounts the ENTIRE React tree, but
the process (and the JsSIP singleton + WebRTC media) lives on** under the
`SipKeepAliveService` FGS. Anything that must keep working while swiped away —
notification button handling, native notification cleanup, Telecom anchor
teardown, SIP registration — must live at **module scope** (imported via
`sipClientSingleton.ts`) or **natively**, never inside `SipContext`/components.
Three separate bugs came from violating this:

1. Notification Hang Up/Speaker/Mute dead after swipe → fixed by module-scope
   listener `apps/mobile/src/sip/inCallNotificationActions.ts` (installed at
   import time by `sipClientSingleton.ts`). `SipContext`'s listener now ONLY
   mirrors UI state — do not re-add client calls there (double-execution).
2. Remote hangup while swiped left a stale in-call notification + phantom
   Telecom call → `nativeCallEndedCleanup()` in `jssip.ts` (fires on last
   confirmed session ended/failed) calls `stopInCallNotification` +
   `telecomTerminateAnchors`; `TelecomBridge.terminateAnchorConnections()`
   tears down `tc-anchor-*` connections natively.
3. Reopening the app mid-call landed on Teams with no way back to the call →
   `SipContext` mount-effect hydration (`[SIP_HYDRATE]` log tag): reads
   `client.listSessions()`, rebuilds callState/remoteParty/hold, replays
   sessions into `CallSessionManager` (which now buckets already-active/held
   sessions and backdates `answeredAt` from `SipSessionInfo.confirmedAtMs` so
   the timer doesn't restart at 0:00).

### Other landmines (do not regress)

- **`react-native-callkeep` used to KILL THE PROCESS in `onHostDestroy`** — that
  was the original "call dies on swipe" cause. Fixed via pnpm patch
  `patches/react-native-callkeep@4.3.16.patch` (wired in root `package.json`
  `pnpm.patchedDependencies`). Never remove that patch.
- **In-call notification uses PLAIN action buttons, not CallStyle.** CallStyle on
  Samsung One UI rendered the Speaker chip white-on-white and silently dropped
  the Mute action. Buttons: Hang up / Speaker / Mute in
  `SipKeepAliveService.buildInCallNotification()`. Hangup rides a
  `PendingIntent.getService` → `ACTION_NOTIF_HANGUP_SVC` → EXPLICIT broadcast to
  `InCallNotificationReceiver` (implicit broadcasts never arrive) → JS event.
  Notification body tap deep-links `com.connectcommunications.mobile://active-call`
  (handled in `RootNavigator`).
- **Audio routing after connect goes through Telecom, not AudioManager.** Once the
  answer-time Telecom anchor flips ACTIVE, `AudioManager.setSpeakerphoneOn` is
  silently overridden. `IncomingCallUiModule.routeViaTelecom()` routes through
  `Connection.setAudioRoute()` first, falling back to AudioManager. `SipContext`
  re-asserts the user's route 600/1800 ms after anchor activation.
- **T-Mobile IPv6 blackhole**: first WSS connect over synthesized IPv6 can hang
  ~10 s. `SipSocketModule.kt` + `nativeSipSocket.ts` (custom OkHttp WebSocket,
  IPv4-first DNS, 6 s connect timeout) fixed cold-start answer from 10 s → ~0.4 s.
  Do not swap SIP back to React Native's stock WebSocket.
- **CGNAT idle kill**: T-Mobile drops idle sockets ≈5 min. Keepalives: JsSIP
  OPTIONS every 45 s foreground; native heartbeat every 4 min
  (`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_STANDING_IDLE_MS`) driving a forced REGISTER refresh via
  the headless task even when JsSIP thinks it's registered.
- **Never re-introduce a VitalPBX tenant PUT / any PBX write** — see the ABSOLUTE
  RULE in `AGENTS.md`. PBX is read-only, enforced in code.

### Shipped in the 2026-07-28 builds (user-visible)

- Instantaneous answer paths (in-app, lock screen, floating notification, cold
  start), `iceCandidatePoolSize: 1`, register watchdogs at 12 s/12.5 s.
- Call survives swipe-away; working notification controls; tap → ActiveCall.
- Speaker/Bluetooth work after connect (Telecom routing).
- Add Call button on ActiveCallScreen (hold current + dial second,
  `allowSecond: true`, reuses `TransferModal` with custom label/icon).
- Voicemail: reload much faster (parallel page fetch in `getVoicemails`, respects
  `maxPagesPerFolder`); Download now saves to the PUBLIC Downloads folder via
  `DownloadsModule.kt` (`ConnectDownloads.saveToDownloads`, MediaStore) with
  filename `Voicemail <caller> <date>.wav`.
- Colored person-icon avatars for unknown numbers (Recents/SMS,
  `colorForName` exported from `Avatar.tsx`).
- Removed the unrequested "Delivery driver" row from Settings.
- Implemented missing `reportDndStatus` in `api/client.ts` (another agent's
  import would have crashed at runtime).

### State at handoff / what to verify next

All of the above is installed on the test device and published to the download
page. Awaiting owner verification at handoff time: hangup/speaker/mute from the
notification **while swiped away**, notification tap → ActiveCall with a running
timer, and voicemail download appearing in Files → Downloads. If a regression
surfaces, start with logcat tags: `IN_CALL_NOTIF`, `SIP_HYDRATE`, `CALL_NAV`,
`MULTICALL`, `SIP_KEEPALIVE`, `CONNECT_CALL_UI`.
