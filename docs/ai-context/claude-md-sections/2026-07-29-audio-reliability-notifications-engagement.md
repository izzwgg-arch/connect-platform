# AGENT HANDOFF — Audio/Reliability/Notifications engagement (2026-07-29)

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


The full handoff for the July 29 all-day session (mobile audio saga, push
notification rebuild, wire-truth SIP liveness, ghost-registration fix, PBX
FEC + wake-rb removal mandates) is committed at
**`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_AUDIO_RELIABILITY_2026-07-29.md`** on branch
`feat/ai-agent`. Read it AND `docs/ai-context/NOTIFICATION_RELIABILITY.md`
BEFORE touching mobile SIP/audio code, push notifications, TURN/relay config,
or the PBX codecs.conf.

Session-critical facts (details + evidence in the handoff doc):
- Published fleet build = `1.0.0+20260729.6` (commit `a0eb96bf`). A `.7`
  candidate (volume-hush + serialized register, commit `a4524f6c`) is built,
  verified on Izzy's phone, and **explicitly NOT published — never publish
  without Izzy's word.**
- Three suspended features need a SUPERVISED incoming-call re-proof, ONE at a
  time (both mic-dead incidents rode builds carrying them): opus-only ANSWERS,
  earpiece loudness boost, presence Equalizer.
- JsSIP discards UA-level pcConfig — per-call `callPcConfig` is the fix; TURN
  creds expire in 24h — `/voice/ice-servers` + register-time overlay keeps
  them fresh. Never regress either.
- PBX mandates live: `[opus] fec=yes, packet_loss=5` (never 10 — it muffles);
  the cowork wake-rb dialplan intercept on T21_101 is DISABLED (backup in
  /root on the PBX).
- The TURN relay (coturn on loopcom) works but is in FRANCE vs the PBX in
  St. Louis (+150ms) — a US relay VPS is the pending purchase/decision.
- One change per build; supervised USB+logcat test before anything
  audio/mic-related reaches Izzy's phone; his sign-off gates every publish.
