# AGENT HANDOFF — Shammes AI agent / PBX M-capabilities engagement (2026-07-26 → 07-28)

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


The full handoff for the AI-agent work (DND, hold music, LLM-first parsing,
chat uploads, and the M3/M4/M10 native PBX capabilities) is committed at
**`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_SHAMMES_PBX_MS.md`** on branch `feat/ai-agent`.
Read it before touching `apps/agent`, the `/internal/agent/*` API doors, or
`scripts/pbx/vitalpbx-inbound-route-helper.py`.

Session-critical facts (details + evidence in the handoff doc):
- **VitalPBX's REST `apply_changes` is broken on this build** — returns success
  without regenerating tenant conf files. The PBX helper therefore **bakes**
  changes directly into `/etc/asterisk/vitalpbx/extensions__50-<t>-dialplan.conf`
  (guarded patch: backup + scope check + atomic replace + dialplan reload).
  Never assume a DB write or REST apply reached live routing — verify the baked
  file / `dialplan show`.
- PBX helper deployed at `/opt/connect-pbx-helper/vitalpbx-inbound-route-helper.py`
  (v2026.08.04.2 as of the vm-greeting engagement, in sync with the repo copy).
  Its `audit.jsonl` is **61 GB** — never grep it whole.
- PBX writes happened ONLY under Izzy's explicit mandates (`dnd-2026-07-26`,
  `moh-2026-07-26`, `pbxcfg-2026-07-28`). The default PBX read-only guardrail
  still stands for anything outside those mandates.
- M3 (inbound routing) + M10 members are live-proven end-to-end through real
  chat on Landau's tenant (T21). M4 (IVR) is built but unproven — the test
  tenant has no IVR, and IVR writes still need the same bake treatment.
- In THIS Cursor environment ssh/scp run directly from PowerShell with the keys
  in `C:\Users\izzyw\.ssh\` — but NEVER pipe file bytes through PowerShell to
  ssh (corruption); always `scp` + remote `py_compile` before installing.
