# AGENT HANDOFF — onboarding round 2 deploy + worktree cleanup (2026-08-05) — READ FIRST for wizard/checkout work, deploys, or worktree hygiene

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_ONBOARDING_ROUND2_DEPLOY_2026-08-05.md`**

- **Production runs merged tip `7f3c7970`** (api job `1ba4879a` container-verified +
  portal): wizard audit round 2 (`cf16ab12`), per-submission provisioning identities
  (`6f5644f2`), port-in retry safety (`3a099489`), stranded-paid-signup watchdog
  (`100a5071`), IVR Studio first-run (`32696a85`), and the rescued api error-leak
  fix (`4fb512ed` — never gate safety behavior on NODE_ENV; the container doesn't set it).
- **`BillingInvoice.onboardingSubmissionId` is UNIQUE** (migration `20260804090000`,
  applied): one first-month invoice per sign-up, enforced by the DB. Checkout
  looks up by that column, catches the P2002 race, and the client checkout POST
  uses a 30 s timeout. Never reintroduce findFirst→create without it.
- Review-step pricing comes from **`GET /onboarding/:token/quote`**; the pure
  input derivation is `apps/api/src/onboarding/quoteInput.ts` (pre-submit reads
  autosaved `answers`, post-submit reads `requestedExtensions` — the `smsEnabled`
  COLUMN is false until submit, don't trust it pre-submit).
- ⛔ **Merging parallel sessions: run tests after EVERY merge** — two clean
  auto-merges still conflicted semantically (subaccount naming vs a new guard
  test; reconciled in `110786d4`). `git merge` succeeding proves nothing.
- **SSH alias is `ssh connect`** (root@45.14.194.179) — "loopcom" does NOT
  resolve on this machine. Deploy queue: token in
  `/opt/connectcomms/env/.env.platform`, api before portal, terminal status is
  the string `success`, api runs `prisma migrate deploy` itself.
- Worktrees cleared 2026-08-05; uncommitted APK-era work is preserved on
  `rescue/cb-voicemail-apk-worktree` + `rescue/connect2build-apk-worktree`.
  ⛔ Branch `cursor/cloud-agent-1773439170847-tqkex` is LOCAL-ONLY on purpose —
  it contains a hardcoded AMI password; scrub before any push.
