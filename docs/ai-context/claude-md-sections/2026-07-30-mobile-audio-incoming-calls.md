# ⛔ AGENT HANDOFF — Mobile audio / incoming calls (2026-07-30) — READ FIRST

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_MOBILE_AUDIO_2026-07-30.md`**
(branch `feat/ai-agent`). Read it before touching `apps/mobile` SIP/audio,
`preferOpusSdp`, the Telecom anchor, or CDR dispositions.

- **UNRESOLVED at handoff: Izzy reports incoming calls not answering.** First
  action: confirm which APK his phone actually runs — `1.0.0+20260730.2` is a
  broken no-connect build; `.3` (commit `64930350`) is the restored one.
- **⛔ NEVER force opus on INBOUND calls from the app.** Both routes are proven
  harmful: opus-only LOCAL ANSWER → dead mic / one-way audio (JsSIP applies
  createAnswer's ORIGINAL to setLocalDescription; only the wire copy is munged);
  opus-only REMOTE OFFER → libwebrtc rejects it, 488, inbound calls never
  connect. Inbound HD is a PBX-side change only, under an explicit mandate.
- **Acceptance test for ANY audio change**: the call CONNECTS *and* the PBX
  `pjsip show channelstats` transmit counter climbs while the user talks.
  "I can hear them" tests only half the pipe — that is how one-way audio shipped.
