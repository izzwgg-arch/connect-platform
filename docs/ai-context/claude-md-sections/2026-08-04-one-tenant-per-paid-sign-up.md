# ⛔ AGENT HANDOFF — one tenant per paid sign-up (2026-08-04) — READ FIRST for onboarding billing / tenant work

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_ONBOARDING_SINGLE_TENANT_2026-08-04.md`**

- **FIXED + DEPLOYED (`1f215755` on feat/ai-agent):** paid sign-ups used to create
  TWO tenants — invoice/card/autopay on the checkout tenant, phone system on a
  second one, so month-2 autopay would have charged an empty orphan. The PBX
  build's `ensureConnectTenant` now adopts `submission.createdTenantId`; if the
  background auto-sync raced it, billing is auto-moved to the live tenant and
  the bare orphan deleted (`onboardingBillingAdoption.ts`).
- Historic splits: `apps/api/scripts/backfill-onboarding-split-tenants.ts`
  (dry-run default, `--fix` applies, refuses non-bare orphans). Prod run
  2026-08-04: **0 splits** — wiped test tenants cascade-delete their invoices,
  so an empty result after a test wipe is expected, not suspicious.
- ⛔ Never re-introduce a fresh `tenant.create` in the orchestrator path while
  `createdTenantId` is set; the regression tests in `setupOrchestrator.test.ts`
  ("checkout tenant reuse", "auto-sync race") guard this.
