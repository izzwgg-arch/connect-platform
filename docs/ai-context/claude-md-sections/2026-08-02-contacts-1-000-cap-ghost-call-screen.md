# ⛔ AGENT HANDOFF — contacts 1,000-cap + ghost call screen (2026-08-02) — READ FIRST for contacts, Android builds, or any "can't save" report

- **"Can't save contacts" was TWO bugs.** `GET /contacts` cut at `take: 1000`, so
  Displaydex's 247 contacts past "Sruly Goldberger" never reached the phone —
  invisible AND unsearchable (the tab filters locally). He then kept re-adding
  people from that invisible tail, the server correctly said `duplicate_phone`,
  and the app named nobody. **16 of 16 iOS saves failed; zero contacts created
  since the 31 Jul import.** Fixed: opt-in `limit`+`cursor` paging (no `limit` =
  the exact legacy 1,000-row response, so the unvirtualized portal is untouched),
  mobile `getContacts()` walks all pages behind the same signature, and the 409
  now names the existing contact. Over the cap: Relax Tires 4,010, Create A Box
  2,002, Displaydex 1,247.
- ⛔ **A call-path fix whose premise is not proven from the DEVICE gets reverted.**
  The first ghost-call fix (`a99caa15`) assumed a lingering dead SIP session;
  logcat showed the session was removed cleanly (`sessions:0`) before the app was
  backgrounded. It also made `listSessions()` mutate state and emit events from
  seven call sites. Reverted in `5076f24f`. **Get logcat first.**
- **Real cause:** Android hands a relaunched activity the SAME intent that started
  the task, so `Linking.getInitialURL()` replayed a 19-second-old
  `incoming-call?action=answer` link. The dedupe Set lived in a `useRef` inside
  the provider — destroyed with the tree — and is cleared on every call-idle. Now
  **module scope**, applied only to the `launch` path so a live tap is never
  refused. Cannot affect iOS (that link is Android-native only; iOS uses CallKit).
- ⛔ **Build Android with `scripts/android-ship.ps1 -SkipJunction`** — the path
  junction breaks Metro's entry-file resolution; the MAX_PATH problem it existed
  for is already fixed by the pnpm patches.
- **Build 47 was never uploaded to App Store Connect.** TestFlight held only
  45/35/32, which is why Eli sat on build 45. **Build 48** (commit `63a01a65`) is
  live to "Loopcom Testers", beta review APPROVED.
- **Verify authenticated API routes from nginx logs, not by minting a token**
  (credential reads are blocked). `Loopcom/NN` = iOS build NN, `okhttp` = Android,
  `Mozilla` = portal.
- **Acceptance test still outstanding:** a second `/api/contacts` request carrying
  `cursor=` from Eli's phone — that request IS his missing 247 contacts arriving.
