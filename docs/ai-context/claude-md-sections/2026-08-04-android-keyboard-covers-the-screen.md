# ⛔ AGENT HANDOFF — Android keyboard covers the screen (2026-08-04) — READ FIRST for any Android layout that sits above the keyboard

Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_ANDROID_KEYBOARD_INSET_2026-08-04.md`**

- **`adjustResize` is dead on Android 15+.** `d111c179` moved the app to
  targetSdk 36; Android 15 (API 35) enforces edge-to-edge for targetSdk 35+ and
  stops resizing the window for the keyboard. The manifest still says
  `adjustResize` and the system ignores it, so the IME draws ON TOP of every
  bottom-anchored control. Nothing in the chat code changed — the chat screen's
  `KeyboardAvoidingView` is iOS-only and had always relied on the OS resize.
- Fixed at the app root by `apps/mobile/src/components/AndroidKeyboardInset.tsx`
  (wraps the navigator in `App.tsx`). Two rules inside it must not be
  "simplified": it applies **only on API 35+** (Android 12–14 still resize
  themselves — padding on top of that shifts every screen up twice), and it pads
  by **`keyboardHeight + insets.bottom`** because RN measures the keyboard from
  the top of the gesture bar, so its number is short by exactly that inset
  (45 px / 15 dp on the S24 — this is what left the composer clipped).
- **A React Native `<Modal>` is its own native window** — the root fix cannot
  reach inside it. Modals with inputs need their own `KeyboardAvoidingView`,
  now `behavior="padding"` on BOTH platforms (`NewChatModal` done;
  `ContactPicker` still has none).
- **Measure, do not eyeball.** Screenshot with `adb exec-out screencap -p` and
  scan the pixels; a by-eye adjustment shipped a build that was still 15 dp low.
- ⛔ **Build with `scripts/android-ship.ps1 -SkipJunction`** — Metro cannot
  resolve the entry file through the `.connect-mobile-build` junction.
- Verified on device: `1.0.0+20260802-143118` (the `20260802` stamp is the build
  shell's slow clock, not a stale build).
