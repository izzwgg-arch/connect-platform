# AGENT HANDOFF — iOS parity engagement (2026-07-30) — READ FIRST for iOS work

> Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-14 when CLAUDE.md was cut down to rules + index. Keep editing THIS file for this area; its one-line entry lives in CLAUDE.md's HANDOFF INDEX.


Full handoff: **`docs/ai-context/AGENT_HANDOFF_IOS_PARITY_2026-07-30.md`**
(branch `feat/ai-agent`). Read it before touching iOS call/push/audio code,
the Recents/Contacts swipe rows, voicemail playback, or the iOS build pipeline.

Session-critical facts (details, commits, and evidence in the handoff doc):
- **iOS build 25 (`f8035997…`, commit `d30c60af`, ios-test profile) is VERIFIED
  WORKING by Izzy — the iOS release candidate**, twin of the restored Android
  build `64930350`. Servers run `602de2b3` (VoIP cancel pushes + iOS-visible
  push envelope live on api+worker).
- iOS lock-screen chain is fixed end-to-end: server-driven VoIP cancel pushes
  (stop-ringing on hangup/voicemail/answered-elsewhere/desk-answer), buffered
  cold-start answer-tap replay (`didLoadWithEvents` — MUST stay the FIRST
  listener on BOTH RNCallKeep and RNVoipPushNotification), ring-time SIP
  prewarm, and a `didActivateAudioSession` gate before the mic opens.
- **Never call WebRTC `getUserMedia` outside the immediate dial/answer path on
  iOS** — a launch-time permission probe killed ALL call audio (build 22).
  Permission prompts use expo-av only. Audio changes ship ALONE, one per build,
  with a supervised two-way call test.
- iOS push notifications require the top-level title/body/sound envelope
  (platform-split in `packages/shared/src/expoMobilePushFormat.ts`) — data-only
  pushes render NOTHING on iOS. Android stays data-only.
- Row swipes are react-native-gesture-handler PanGestureHandler — PanResponder
  loses a native race to the FlatList scroll recognizer on iOS. Voicemail list
  fetch stays capped (`maxPagesPerFolder: 2`).
- Builds: Metro needs `--offline` (Izzy's filtered line), dev client connects
  via Tailscale IP `http://100.92.168.53:8081`, EAS builds submit from loopcom
  (`/tmp/connect-ios-build`, `gh` remote, `EAS_NO_VCS=1`), delete-before-install
  + bump `ios.buildNumber` every build.
